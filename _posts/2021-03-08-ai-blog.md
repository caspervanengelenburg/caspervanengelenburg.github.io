“Will robots [eventually] outmaneuver us and take over our planet?”, “Artificial Intelligence is our most ingenious invention! And our last one … ”, “What about the jobs they’ll take over: will there be anything left for us to do?” (see picture), “Yeah sure … let me assure you that the impact of artificial intelligence is highly overrated!”, “Nowadays, using artificial intelligence is just playing cool!”, “Woohoo, artificial intelligence is and will be THE solution to all our problems!”, “Artificial intelligence you said? Don’t bother me … artificial nonsense is what you mean!”, “I fear for a future in which all news feeds are unreliable, all algorithms are racially biased and income is even more unequally distributed.”


In between the end of my thesis and the start of my PhD, I took some time to read a lot of books on AI, a domain that started to fascinate me for a while already back then. Also, I started, although in retrospect maybe somewhat ambitious at the time, a blog series on AI (for which I only finished one post). I hope to start delve into and write about some of the more broader AI topics when I have the time. For now, writings will be mostly focused topics related to the PhD.

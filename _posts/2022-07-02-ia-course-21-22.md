In the second semester of 21/22, I was part of the teaching team in two successive courses at our faculty: MSc 2 Complex Projects _workshop_ **[1:1 Interactive Architecture Prototypes](http://uf.roboticbuilding.eu/index.php/W12022)** and MSc 2 Complex Projects _studio_ **[Interactive Architecture](http://uf.roboticbuilding.eu/index.php/MSc2TUD2022)**. Both courses emphasized on the integration of a prototypical design process, robotics, Computer vision, and user interaction. 


## Code base
In collaboration with [Seyran Khademi](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/seyran-khademi), we developed a **Python-based code repository** the students could use for the Computer vision part of the workshop: [click here](https://github.com/caspervanengelenburg/1on1-prototyping-IA-CV-sessions) (feel free to have a look and use it).

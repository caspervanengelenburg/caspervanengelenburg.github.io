My **BSc. thesis** (_Applied Physics_, Delft University of Technology) revolved around experiments with double-nanopore systems for improved understanding of the manipulation and detection of single molecules - in our case to read out the DNA molecule. Part of the following **publication**, published in [ACS Publications](https://pubs.acs.org/), made use of the experiments we did: [Mechanical Trapping of DNA in a Double-Nanopore System](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b04642).

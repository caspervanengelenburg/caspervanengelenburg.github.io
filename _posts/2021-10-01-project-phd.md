In October 2021, I joined the _[AiDAPT lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/aidapt)_ as a **PhD candidate** at the faculty of _Architecture and the Built-Environment_! 

Under supervision of [Seyran Khademi](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/seyran-khademi) (Co-director _AiDAPT lab_), and promoters [Georg Vrachliotis](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk/over-faculteit/hoogleraren/profdr-g-vrachliotis) (Head _[Digital Culture Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk/over-faculteit/afdelingen/architecture/organisatie/groepen/theory-of-architecture-and-digital-culture)_, Delft), [Jan van Gemert](https://jvgemert.github.io/) (Head _[Computer Vision Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab)_, Delft), and [Charalampos Andriotis](https://www.cpandriotis.com/) (Co-director _AiDAPT lab_), I will do research at the **intersection between Computer vision and early-stage Architectural design and research practices**. 


## Topic
Architects communicate their designs through various visual abstractions of the physical space; including orthographic drawings, photos, and 3D models. Semantic similarity learning for architectural drawings is the topic of my PhD, focusing on understanding visual patterns in floorplan image data. He develops deep contrastive learning frameworks that enable to learn low-dimensional, task-agnostic representations of architectural drawings. This research line builds a foundation for large quantitative analysis of archival and linked visual data.
